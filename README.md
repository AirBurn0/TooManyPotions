Public repository for TooManyPotions (Potion Craft Mod / BepInEx 5 plugin) - a small GUI tool for manual testing of modded PotionCraft. Can be used as a cheat, however.

# Dependencies
[ReLocalization](https://github.com/AirBurn0/ReLocalization) - makes it easier to work with localization.

[BepInEx](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx) - modloader;

## What is it for?
Includes the following features:

* Auto-haggle;
* Toggle dev-mode;
* Teleport and rotate potion on potion map to cursor;
* Stop taking damage (potion becomes invincible);
* Edit money, popularity and reputation;
* Duplicate items in inventory;
* Add any ingredient/salt to inventory;
* Add any existing potion effect to the currently brewing potion;
* Switch maps (even to not unlocked ones).
* This should make modding somewhat easier in terms of testing.
